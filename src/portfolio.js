      'I approach design and development with a practical mindset shaped by my background in computer science, software engineering, and business. My process is intentional and thoughtful, rooted in clarity, accessibility, and real-world impact. The web is not just a place to display information. It is a medium for expression, a system to question, and a tool to build with care. My recent work includes designing a platform that advocates for safer bike infrastructure in my hometown, and building a social impact app during a university hackathon. Each was rooted in the same belief: that good design is civic, thoughtful, and human. This is the foundation for the studio Iâ€™m building. A studio committed to using design and code to engage with the world, not escape it. I aim to create experiences that are functional, meaningful, and built to last.',
